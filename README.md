# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
With the use of R studio, along with the MechaCar_mpg.csv file and Suspension_Coil.csv file, I will be doing the following in this challenge:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using your knowledge of R, you’ll design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.
### Analysis
H0 : The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
Ha : The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m ≠ 0

#### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
